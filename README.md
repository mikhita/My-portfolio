# Frontend Mentor - Single-page design portfolio

![Design preview for the Single-page design portfolio coding challenge](./preview.jpg)


[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help me improve my coding skills by building realistic projects. These premium challenges are perfect portfolio pieces, so what I create in my portfolio, I will save in my github page - to show others.

**To do this challenge, I think I need a strong understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.**

## The challenge

My challenge was to build out this single-page design portfolio site and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

I can use any tools I like to help myself complete the challenge. So if I've got something I'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

My users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Navigate the slider using either their mouse/trackpad or keyboard

## Building My project

I use any workflow that I feel comfortable with. Below is a suggested process, steps that I follow:

1. Separate the `starter-code` from the rest of this project and rename it to something meaningful for you. Initialize the codebase as a public repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/). Creating a repo will make it easier to share your code with the community if you need help. If you're not sure how to do this, [have a read-through of this Try Git resource](https://try.github.io/). **⚠️ IMPORTANT ⚠️: There are already a couple of `.gitignore` files in this project. Please do not remove them or change the content of the files. If you create a brand new project, please use the `.gitignore` files provided in your new codebase. This is to avoid the accidental upload of the design files to GitHub. With these premium challenges, please be sure not to share the design files in your GitHub repo. Thanks!**
2. Configure your repository to publish your code to a web address. This will also be useful if you need some help during a challenge as you can share the URL for your project with your repo URL. There are a number of ways to do this, and we provide some recommendations below.
3. Look through the designs to start planning out how you'll tackle the project. This step is crucial to help you think ahead for CSS classes to create reusable styles.
4. Before adding any styles, structure your content with HTML. Writing your HTML first can help focus your attention on creating well-structured content.
5. Write out the base styles for your project, including general content styles, such as `font-family` and `font-size`.
6. Start adding styles to the top of the page and work down. Only move on to the next section once you're happy you've completed the area you're working on.

## Deploying your project

I host my project for free. My recommend host is:

- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)

## Sharing your solution

There are multiple places I can share my solution:

1. on github[GitHub Pages](https://github.com/mikhita)
2. Share your solution on other social channels like LinkedIn(https://www.linkedin.com/feed/).
3. my live website link().

The more specific you are with your questions the more likely it is that another member of the community will give you feedback.
